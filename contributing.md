# Contribution Guidelines
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Search included research papers before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) (Year) - Description.`
- Adding the Year is optional but is advised.
- The paper should be put into its appropriate category (Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure).
- If you want to add a link to notes for the research paper, add it below the paper as subdashed point.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- You can also add other related websites and repositories in the end.
